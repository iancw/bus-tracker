== Bus Tracker Intro

The bus tracker shows bus position and route information from WMATA.  It uses rails, but has to do a lot with javascript both for google maps integration and for live updates of bus positions without requiring an entire reload.  This kind of edges us away from the 'rails way.'

For now it just uses one route - /buses.  Theoretically in the future it could use other URLs for specific things -- different map configurations, or focusing on specific routes.
